My full name is William Owen McAuliff IV, and I go by "Will." I am the eldest son of a US postal worker and an elementary schoolteacher. I was born and raised in Central Florida, although my mother and her family are originally from Puerto Rico. I studied computer science in New York City at Columbia University, and today I write software for a living.

I am fascinated by the mental models we use to understand the world. Stephen R. Covey described this aptly: "We see the world, not as _it is_, but as _we are_--or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our mouths to describe what we see, we in effect describe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms."

My hobbies include running, listening to podcasts, and, hopefully now, blogging.
